                Besides enjoying work in web development, I also love
                photography (even if I’m not professional, at least not yet)
                exploring new places, <strong>hiking on weekdays </strong>in the
                outskirts, <strong>riding </strong>my bike and doing morning
                workout.
              </p>

            <div>
              <p>
                These activities give me a lot of <strong>inspiration </strong>.
                Here I share with you some photos of my days, reflecting what
                inspires me both in my{" "}
                <strong>professional and personal </strong> life.

                I’m a curious mind. I’d like to learn several languages, and I’m
                currently <strong>learning English </strong>. I’m proficient in
                writing and technical reading, and I’m working on improving my
                communication skills. I’m also self-learning at French.

              The hike-pandas project was inspired by the idea of tracking the
              places I visit from time to time.
